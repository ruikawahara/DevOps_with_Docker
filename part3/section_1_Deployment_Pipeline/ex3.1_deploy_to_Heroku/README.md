## Exercise 3.1 - Deploy pipeline to Heroku

Use GitHub, GitHub Action, and Heroku to deploy container to Heroku. You may use any web application.

---

## Solution

For this exercise, I will be using the the [forked docker-hy repository](https://github.com/ruikawahara/docker-hy.github.io) from *[Deployment Pipeline](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-3/2-deployment-pipelines)* chapter.

You can see the deployed container from [this](https://ex3-1.herokuapp.com/) link.
