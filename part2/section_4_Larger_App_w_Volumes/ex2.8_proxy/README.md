# 4. Larger Application with Volumes

## Exercise 2.8 - Proxy

We will continue from [ex 2.6](../ex2.6_database). 

Use [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx) to set a reverse proxy that connects both frontend and backend.

To simplify, your proxy should:
- Take request and send back result instead of frontend.
- Any `/api` requests get redirected to backend.
- Any other requests will get redirected to frontend.
- Must be in same network.

Check your result at [http://localhost](http://localhost).
