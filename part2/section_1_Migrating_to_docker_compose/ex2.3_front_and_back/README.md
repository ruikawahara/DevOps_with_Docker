# 1. Migrating to docker-compose.yml

## Exercise 2.3 - Front and Back

Simplify the frontend & backend project (ex.1.4) so that it only uses single `docker-compse.yml` to run.

---

## Solution

You will still need a `Dockerfile` from 1.4. Make sure you have them copied into right place (i.e. ).

Once you have correct files in correct directories, run the docker-compose with `docker-compose.yml`.

For specific implementation of docker-compose, please refer to `docker-compose.yml` located in this directory.
